solve these later:
-----------------
cf770 - mods
uva 10110 - not enough math knowldge
uva 10106 - big integer/tried the solution / (s[i] - '0');
uva 408 - step / mode - could not solve
uva 11231 - impl/cs - easy comeback
uva 12148 - heavy impleantation with cleanreder/ probly math 
spj ezmath - inclusion/exclusin - easy pb / hard ans

leaned keep:
-memset - memset(where to store, what to copy, how many times copy);
